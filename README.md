# Advent of Code 2024 - Learning Rust

My [Advent of Code 2024](https://adventofcode.com/2024/) solutions in the Rust
programming language.

- This code is by no means perfect, I am using AoC-2024 to learn Rust :)
- Each of the exercises is done separately with no common code in common
  components.

## Usage

- Each solution is in it's own folder.

- The example input (example.txt) and individual input
  (input.txt) is expected to be placed in each root folder.

- For copyright reasons the input files are not included in the folders (see
  [AoC copyright info](https://adventofcode.com/about#faq_copying)).

- Which of both files is used is controlled by a boolean USE_EXAMPLE in each
  main.rs (true -> use example.txt, false -> use input.txt).

- In the case of using the example input verbose debugging infos are printed.
